#About

Hi there! You can call me Jeorge or Alex. I recently completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the 
Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) with a specialization in Software 
Development. This is my portfolio where I showcase the projects that I had the 
opportunity to work on throughout my academic journey. 

It is through such projects that I was able to collaborate and learn with others, 
enhance my technical skills, and discover my areas of interest in this field, 
which include UI/UX design, quality assurance, and back-end development. 

I look forward 
to entering a career path that allows me to further explore these interests 
while remaining open to new challenges and opportunities.
