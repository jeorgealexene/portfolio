                <p class="hero-desc long">Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase the projects and certificates that I've had the opportunity to work on throughout my academic journey at PUP Manila. It is through such opportunities that I was able to collaborate and learn with others, enhance my technical skills, and discover my areas of interest in this field, which include UI/UX design, quality assurance, and back-end development. </p>
                <p class="hero-desc short">I look forward to entering a career path that allows me to further explore these interests while remaining open to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
